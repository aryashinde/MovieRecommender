# MovieRecommender
MovieRecommender project dwells into the concept of recommendation system. <br> 
There are 2 kind of recommender systems:
1. Content-Based Recommender system: Content-based recommender systems suggest items to users by analyzing item features and comparing them to the userâ€™s preferences. They rely on attributes or characteristics of the items themselves, using keywords, genres, categories, or other attributes that match the user's past interactions or explicitly stated preferences. For example, a movie recommendation system might suggest movies of the same genre or with similar actors that the user has previously liked.
   
3. Collaborative Filtering Based Recommender system: Collaborative filtering recommender systems suggest items based on user behavior and preferences. This type of system assumes that users who have agreed on items in the past will likely agree again in the future. Collaborative filtering can be user-based, where recommendations are based on the preferences of similar users, or item-based, where items with similar ratings or interactions are recommended to the user. An example is suggesting movies liked by users with similar viewing habits.

This Project is based on the 'Content-Based Recommender system'.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
